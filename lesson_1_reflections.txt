How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it real easy to locate.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    By maintaining a record of all changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Changes should be atomic to functional change implemented.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git was designed by a developer for code development purposes which
    routinely need to commit multiple file changes as an atomic change to the
    code base.
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    $ git log --stat # then "/<string>" to search for comment

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    Knowing that you can always go back to a good, working code base.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Small coding projects.

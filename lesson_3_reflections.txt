>>> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local?

When you are ready to release a set of changes, say for a feature that you've 
been working on, that others may now access, use, and test.

>>> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Many reasons.  One big reason is that you don't want code changes pushed 
    from the GitHub repo to your local code base automatically changing the 
    code that you are in the middle of working on.  You want to have control
    over when that happens...preferably when you are completely done with the
    new feature or bug fix.
